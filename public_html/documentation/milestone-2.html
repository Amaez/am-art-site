        <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
            <p>My website will be one page and need a simple layout based around a vertical scroll layout. This format will
            make it easily accessible on mobile formats and tends to make step-by-step tutorials easier to follow and process.</p>
    </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Introduction and website overview</h2>
            <p>In the first content section of the website I would like to provide the user with some information regarding my experience as an artist as well as what my
        intentions are in creating this website. This will help inform users on what to expect and aid them in deciding whether the reference material I am
        providing matches their particular goals. This may include an example of my art and a clear and informative paragraph in the same section.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Materials Section</h2>
            <p>Before getting into the tutorial, I believe it is most useful for beginners to know what tools other artists are using, especially in reference to one
        particular work. Providing this information will help artists choosing to follow along prep their work space and make it easier for them to follow along.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Planning and beginning a drawing/illustration</h2>
        <p>As you become more experienced, your process for planning and beginning a drawing or illustration naturally needs to become more sophisticated.
        This section will go over the importance of collecting reference material, thinking about colors, and finding out if you want to use a certain artistic technique before you
        actually begin drawing. I will explain the importance of using reference and how I usually collect and use reference.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Tutorial Section</h2>
        <p>Once the basics have been covered, I will get into the actual tutorial. I plan to draw an example for the tutorial and record the process in order to deconstruct my
        process in a step-by step manner. This section will include an image showing what stage of the process I am explaining and have a description/explanation of what is happening for each step.
        While there will be several steps portrayed, each image and description is a part of the single bigger section of the tutorial. I plan to include these steps in the tutorial section:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Creating a background</strong> - why doing even a rough background before doing a character sketch is important when starting a new drawing.</li>
            <li><strong>Sketch process</strong> - thumbnailing, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Sketch refinement</strong> - how to go about refining a sketch and the importance of doing so in my process.</li>
            <li><strong>Lineart</strong> - how I go about using line weight and what brushes I use.</li>
            <li><strong>Shading</strong> - what to think about when shading and light sources- conventionally, color usually comes before shading, but in the greyscale method of painting, the coloring method needs to come after the shadows are placed.</li>
            <li><strong>Coloring</strong> - how to choose colors that accurately represent the subject, but are vibrant enough to make up for the colorless base they are painted over.</li>
            <li><strong>Detail refinement and adjustments</strong> - details how to meld the character with the background more cohesively and what details can be added to improve and stylize the drawing.</li>
            <li><strong>Finishing a drawing</strong> - may include where and how to post your drawing and an artists options for including a signature or watermark.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Video Section</h2>
        <p>In this section I will have a sped-up video of my process in order to provide a more dynamic view of the process the user has just followed.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Contact Form</h2>
        <p>At the bottom of the page I will have a contact form inviting users to submit a request for additional topics they would like to see covered and also to request information on commissions.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Footer</h2>
            <p>My footer will contain links to my Twitter and Trello page so that visitors will be able to find more of my art
            as well as my commission prices.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <p>I used Procreate to create the wireframe designs of my website.</p>

        <h2>Mobile Layout</h2>
