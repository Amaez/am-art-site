        <h1>Content Strategy:</h1>
            <p>My website will be one page and need a simple layout with a vertical scroll centered design. This format will
            make it easily accessible on mobile formats and tends to make step-by-step tutorials easier to follow and process.</p>

        <h1>Introduction and website overview:</h1>
        <p>In the first content section of the website I would like to provide the user with some information regarding my experience as an artist as well as what my
        intentions are in creating this website. This will help inform users on what to expect and aid them in deciding whether the reference material I am
        providing matches their particular goals. This may include an example of my art and a clear and informative paragraph in the same section.</p>

        <h1>Materials Section</h1>
        <p>Before getting into the tutorial, I believe it is most useful for beginners to know what tools other artists are using, especially in reference to one
        particular work. Providing this information will help artists choosing to follow along prep their work space and make it easier for them to follow along.</p>
