        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>The purpose of my PWP is to provide beginner-friendly tutorials to artists that are either just starting,
        wanting to brush up on their basics, or interested in learning about my art techniques. I found walkthroughs by
        artists that I looked up to incredibly helpful when I was just starting and I would like to give back to the online
        art community in the same way.</p>

            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>My site will be viewed and used mainly by fellow artists, mostly by those that are interested in learning about digital art.
            My website is designed to give simple, advice on the art basics that I feel comfortable demonstrating,
            and a walkthrough of my current art process. The main goal of this project is to help my peers in the art community by teaching them
                how to begin and improve their digital art, with a
            secondary goal being promoting my work in order to gain more followers and clientele for my commissioned works.</p>
