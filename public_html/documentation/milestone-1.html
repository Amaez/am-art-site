        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>The purpose of my PWP is to provide beginner-friendly tutorials to artists that are either just starting,
        wanting to brush up on their basics, or interested in learning about my art techniques.</p>
        <p>I found walkthroughs made by artists that I looked up to incredibly helpful when I was just starting and I would like to give back to the online
        art community in the same way.</p>

            <p>My website is designed to give simple, advice on the art basics that I feel comfortable demonstrating,

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>The main goal of this project is to help my peers in the art community by teaching them how to begin and improve their digital art, with a
                secondary goal of promoting my work in order to gain more followers and clientele for my commissioned works.</p>

            <h4>Persona</h4>
                <img src="images/persona-PWP.jpeg" alt="a young woman with short curly hair draws at her desk">
                    <p>Name:</p>
                    <p>Mary Esso</p>
                    <p>Age:</p>
                    <p>23</p>
                    <p>Gender:</p>
                    <p>Female</p>
                    <p>Occupation:</p>
                    <p>Part-time student and part-time cashier.</p>
                    <p>Technology:</p>
                    <p>HP Pavillion running Mozilla Firefox 77.01 | Apple iPad Pro 12.9" running iPad OS | Wacom Intuos Tablet</p>
                    <p>Tech literacy level:</p>
                    <p>Overall, intermediate. Mary knows how to navigate the web to search for art and post her art online,
                    as well as enough to be familiar with different digital art programs and how to research material to learn from.
                    She has a strong general working knowledge that allows her to feel confident attempting to learn digital art.</p>
                    <p>Does she love or hate it?:</p>
                    <p>She enjoys her technology and how useful it is, but due to her array of devices, needs a website that is accessible
                    both on desktop and her iPad in order to reference whilst drawing. She doesn't want to feel like she can
                    only learn if using one device.</p>
                    <p>Challenges:</p>
                    <p>Mary feels confident in her passion for art, and while she is inspired by many digital artists, she feels that she isn't experienced enough yet to be able to learn what an artist's
                        techniques are simply by looking at a lot of reference material or through trial and error. <p>Mary feels like she spends a lot of time drawing but can't get her art to where she wants it to be.</p>
                    <p>She likes being walked through the basics because she knows how important they are,
                    and from there she feels confident expanding into her own personal style.</p>
                    <p>Mary also doesn't feel like she has enough time to disseminate information from lengthy books or articles,
                    and remembers better when she sees things laid out visually and can see the results of the steps that she is learning from.</p>
