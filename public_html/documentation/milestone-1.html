        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>The purpose of my PWP is to provide beginner-friendly tutorials to artists that are either just starting,
        wanting to brush up on their basics, or interested in learning about my art techniques.</p>
        <p>I found walkthroughs made by artists that I looked up to incredibly helpful when I was just starting and I would like to give back to the online
        art community in the same way.</p>

            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>My site will be viewed and used mainly by fellow artists, mostly by those that are interested in learning about digital art.</p>
            <p>My website is designed to give simple, advice on the art basics that I feel comfortable demonstrating,
                and a walkthrough of my current art process.</p>
            <p>The main goal of this project is to help my peers in the art community by teaching them how to begin and improve their digital art, with a
                secondary goal of promoting my work in order to gain more followers and clientele for my commissioned works.</p>
