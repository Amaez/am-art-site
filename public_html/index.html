        <p>
            Welcome! My name is Alice (alternatively known as Benevolent Poodle) I am an illustrator, and I have been taking commissions from clients for over 5 years.

        <p>As I was starting my freelance work, the tutorials provided online by fellow artists propelled me through my initial stages of improvement, and were invaluable to my growth.</p>

        <p>I owe a lot to the artists that took the time to share their resources online, and this gratitude has inspired me to contribute similar tutorials in the hopes that they can be of some help to others!</p>

            <p>Here you will find my first in-depth tutorial demonstrating how I achieve the particular moods and effects seen in my digital illustrations.</p>

                <p>When I need to use a bigger screen I use the HP Envy 17t-C9000 laptop. Paint Tool Sai is currently only compatible with Windows OS, so I avoid Apple products for stationary work. With it I use a basic drawing tablet- the Wacom Bamboo CTH-670. A simple tablet like this with a surface area close to the size of sketchbook you use for traditional artworks is perfect for those just starting out.</p>
                <p>Finally, pictured is the reference book "Color and Light" by James Gurney. This is an excellent guide to making your lighting more interesting and realistic. You don't have to use this book, but do take it's place
                on this materials list as my recommending you to use reference whenever possible.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Upon beginning any illustration, I usually have a rough notion of the mood and pose of my subject in mind. To fully realize and bring this sometimes nebulous idea to light,
                I like to make a reference/mood board using Vizref (for my ipad) or Pureref (for my laptop). I choose reference ranging from photos of nature (Unsplash is a wonderful resource for no-copyright references) to
                art by artists that I admire and look up to. Choose reference of the highest quality you can find to take in as much detail as possible. Be mindful to stay as close to your imagined mood and feel as possible when collecting materials so as not to confuse yourself later on.
                Unless you have already been inspired by the pose of an image and plan to use that specifically, it is rare that you will find pose reference that matches what you have imagined exactly,
                so collect as many similar angles as possible to then combine visually as you sketch.</p>

                    It is best to create a rough draft of your background before adding your subject in order to organically place the character within your planned environment. Find several photos that capture the color, mood, and story you envision for your illustration.
                    Add the image to your project in a new layer and color-pick from your reference image. Block out the main color areas and blend them to create a gradient. The background is not finished at this stage, but more details will be added later on.

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Step Two - Starting your Sketch</h5>
                    <p>I do at least 2 sketches per drawing, and they are as follows -</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>Preliminary Gesture Sketch - This sketch is solely to work out the shape, pose, movement, and general proportion of your subject without worrying about details or finesse.</li>
                    <li>Refined Sketch - Once the preliminary sketch is to your liking, you can begin refining and adding details. The more time you spend on this stage, the more detailed and easy to line your piece will be.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>These can be easy steps to get discouraged on, but keep in mind that all sketches look messy at first. Have faith in the process and your growing skills!</p>


                    <p>If you struggle to achieve crisp lineart, start by examining your sketch. Try to remove as much guesswork as you can about the anatomy in the sketching stage. This way, you aren’t guessing to compensate as you line.
                    After completing the refined sketch, I lower the sketch layer’s opacity in preparation for lining.
                        In this stage I will also refine the colors and detail in the background. Now that the final sketch is done, I have a better idea of the character’s placement in the scene and can begin to build around it.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Step Three - Lineart</h5>
                    Even though my style leans more painterly, I like having a clear, weighty lineart to work off of. I tend to chip away at it in the painting stage and like to have hints of the lines peek through in my finished illustration. I use a clean, hard brush with no texture that is responsive to pen pressure. I darken the areas where the lines meet for emphasis, and use a smaller brush size for small details. I greatly enjoy lining, but the time you spend on this stage will be proportionate to the style you are going for.

            <img src="images/step-4.png" id="step4" alt="Two stacked screenshots of a procreate and Vizref board taken from an iPad screen. The top image shows instructions on where to place the color layer and the bottom picture shows the unfinished coloring of the wolf lineart.">

                    <h5 class="card-title">Step Four - Color</h5>
                    <p>Create a new layer underneath your lineart and rename it “color”.</p>

                    <p>At this point, I will also make a separate layer to add my character reference to (if I’m working with one) so that I can color pick.
                        To fill in the color layer, I use the most prominent color in the design. After that, I block in the biggest secondary color groups, all the way up to the smallest color groups such as eyes and accent colors. If you are doing commission work for a client, ask for a flat color reference sheet and try to add all of the smallest details to ensure an accurate portrayal of the character’s marking.</p>

<div class="container  m-4">
    <div class="row">

            <img src="images/step-5.png" id="step5" alt="Two stacked screenshots of a procreate and Vizref board taken from an iPad screen. The top image shows the finished flat markings of the wolf and the bottom picture shows a greyscale shading layer.">

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Step Five - Shading</h5>
                    <p>Once the base color is done, I duplicate the color layer, and take the following steps:</p>
                    <ul><li>Place the new layer above the color layer</li>
                    <li>Alpha lock it, and fill it in with a light grey base color.</li></ul>

                    <p>I then identify my light source and block in the largest general shaded areas with a slightly darker grey. Areas where limbs/objects/body parts are very close or overlap will be some of the darkest parts of your illustration, so darken the shade of grey you use for them.</p>

                    <p>This method is known as greyscale painting- where you use grey to shade the subject and then set it to multiply to then make it colorful again. You run the risk of having undersaturated works using this method, but the way I get around this is by making a new layer with a clipping mask attached to the shade layer when it’s finished and then fill it with purple or blue or a similar pleasant shade that matches your illustration. Set this color layer to overlay and merge it into your shade layer. This adds color to the shading layer which then adds more depth and saturation when merged into the color layer.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Step Six - Lighting</h5>
                    It is especially important to keep in mind the intensity and source of your light when adding it to your drawing. At this point, your shade and color layers should be merged. I add the colored light by color dropping the background in more subdued areas before painting it along the outline of the character with a soft airbrush. Once I have the colors set, I blend the colors together and blur the inner line of the light to emulate light diffusing the further it gets from the source. I add the colors based on which color of cloud is facing certain parts of the body.

The top image shows the image after some painting and refinement and the bottom picture shows the finished result- a grey and white wolf with flowing black hair and grey glasses standing against a pink, blue, and purple cloudy sky.">
            <div class="card" id="step-seven">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Step Seven - Final detail</h5>
                    Make the light layer a clipping mask of the shade/color layer and merge it down so there isn’t any color spilling over the edge. Up until now we have been adding quite broad areas of shade and light to the image, so in this step I make sure that the lighting is consistent and add any highlights and detailed shading that is needed for more realism. You may have lost some depth in your shadows by adding the lighting, so it is important to add the darker colors back in to create a more realistic feel. The detail adding process can be as basic or as exhaustive as you would like it to be. The more you practice, the more easily you will come to recognize when you have reached a satisfying amount of detail that is not too simple or overwhelming to the eye.
